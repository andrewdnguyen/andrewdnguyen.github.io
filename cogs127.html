            <h1>Improving Physical Connections on LinkedIn</h1>

            <h2>Project Objectives</h2>

            <p>
                In redesigning LinkedIn, our team hopes to enable workers in the tech industry to improve their 
                professional skills and networks.
            </p>

            <h2>Design Prompt</h2>

            <p>
                Using an well-known social media app, extend or redesign a feature that helps encourage specific types 
                of people in one's surrounding area to get together in-person and physically interact in a meaningful 
                way. 
            </p>

            <h2>Target User</h2>

            <p>
                    Our team has decided to use workers in the tech sector as our target user. 
                    This demographic was chosen for reasons including but not limited to:
            </p>

            <h4>Size of Industry</h4>
            <p>
                    The tech sector is one of the most rapidly growing industries in the US, employing nearly 12 million people in total, with roughly 261,000 jobs added in the last year. 
                    As a group, we expect that this continuous growth will incentivize workers in the industry to pursue further development 
                    within this field.
            </p>

            <h4>Access to a Broad Range of Target Users</h4>
            <p>
                    As a large university with reputation both in academia and industry, we have easy access to 
                    professionals of various levels of skills from students beginning their careers through internships 
                    to alumni with years of experience in the field. UCSD also has several programs which cover a variety
                    of tech career paths from software engineering to data science to UX design and more. 
            </p>

            <h4>Empathy and Equity</h4>
            <p>
                    As individuals nearly entering the workforce ourselves, we as a group find it easy to empathize 
                    with our target users as we along with many of our peers look to develop ourselves for full-time 
                    employment.
                    <br><br>
                    We also feel that while UCSD and other large universities provide opportunities for development to 
                    their students, many people without access to these opportunities are at a disadvantage when 
                    competing for jobs and pay in the industry. By improving a relatively accessible application such as 
                    LinkedIn we hope to not only improve the usefulness of the app overall, but also help those with fewer 
                    development opportunities.
            </p>
